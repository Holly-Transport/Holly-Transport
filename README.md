- 👋 Hi, I’m @Holly-Transport
- 👀 I’m interested in dreaming up creative tech solutions to development challenges in emerging economies. 
- 🌱 For work, I'm learning how to manage soup-to-nuts data science projects, and for fun, I'm learning French (_mange bien, riez souvent, aimez beaucoup!_)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Development Data Partnership: https://datapartnership.org/
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-krambeck
